The GenericAnomalousCommunitiesDetection repository is a project that implements CMMAC algorithm, am algorithm for detection of anomalous communities in complex networks, described in the paper (later to be addedâ€¦).
It also contains the Anomaly-Infused Community-Structured Random-Network Generator, the Evaulation process and the Real-world Examples used in the paper.

## To do:
- [ ] Describe how to use the code
- [ ] Finish documenting the code
